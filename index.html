<h2>Bio</h2>

<p>Not a poet: Ross Goodwin is an artist, creative technologist, hacker, gonzo data scientist, and former White House ghostwriter. Goodwin employs machine learning, natural language processing (NLP) & generation (NLG), physical computing, and other technologies to realize new forms and interfaces for written language.</p>

<p>Goodwin’s projects and collaborations have earned international acclaim: from <a href="https://word.camera">word.camera</a>, a camera that expressively narrates its photographs in real time using artificial neural networks (web app + installations, 2015-present), to <a href="http://www.thereforefilms.com/sunspring.html"><em>SUNSPRING</em></a>, the world's first film created from an AI-written screenplay (2016 short film, directed by Oscar Sharp, starring Thomas Middleditch); from making London’s Trafalgar Square lions roar poetry (2018, <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/project/please-feed-the-lions"><em>Please Feed The Lions</em></a> with Es Devlin), to writing a novel with a car (2017-2018, <a href="https://1theroad.com"><u>1 the Road</u></a>).</p>

<p>Working outside traditional arts funding models, Goodwin has received sponsorship from large technology companies like Google and AT&T, media companies like iHeart and BuzzFeed, news outlets like The Economist and Univision, academic institutions like Teacher’s College at Columbia University, and fashion houses like Rag & Bone. However, Goodwin also has produced significant volumes of indepedent creative work directly from his personal studio—prototyping original ideas rapidly on limited budgets, and sharing results in real time both online and physically.</p>

<p>Although he began his B.S. degree in Physics in 2005-2006, and despite working full-time on the 2008 Obama campaign and 2008-2009 Obama-Biden Presidential Transition Team as a ghostwriter and completing numerous other internships along with extracurricular commitments, Goodwin earned his undergraduate degree in Economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (in seven semesters, with the exact number of required units) in May 2009. His first job out of college was a Presidential Writer position at The White House, where he wrote nearly 100 Presidential Proclamations. After next working at the U.S. Treasury Department on financial regulatory reform, Goodwin taught himself to code, then gravitated immediately to natural language processing, natural language generation, and computational creative writing. Goodwin earned his graduate degree from the Interactive Telecommunications Program a.k.a. Insane Technology Posse a.k.a. ITP at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts in May 2016.</p>

<p>Winner of the <a href="https://www.idfa.nl/en/selection/106919/doclab-competition-for-digital-storytelling">2018 IDFA DocLab Award for Digital Storytelling</a> as well as Columbia University's <a href="http://digitaldozen.io/2019-awards/">Digital Dozen Breakthroughs in Storytelling Award for 2019</a>, Goodwin has exhibited work &/or spoken at <a href="https://ars.electronica.art/ai/en/sunspring/">Ars Electronica</a>, <a href="https://www.londondesignfestival.com/event/es-devlin-please-feed-lions">London Design Festival</a>, <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2019/02/rag-and-bone-dinner-party-nyfw-fall-winter-2019.html">NYC Fashion Week</a>, Sundance Film Festival, Cannes Lions, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/03/11/google-empathy-lab-founder-ai-will-upend-storytelling-and-human-machine-interaction/">SXSW</a>, <a href="https://www.barbican.org.uk/sites/default/files/documents/2019-04/FINAL%20AI%20More%20than%20Human%20exhibition%20release%20280219_1.pdf">the Barbican</a>, the London Science Museum, <a href="https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/christmas-tree-installations">the V&A Museum</a>, the Serpentine Galleries, <a href="https://dublin.sciencegallery.com/hnna/exhibits/wordcamera/">Science Gallery International</a>, the World Economic Forum, <a href="https://www.vrai.pictures/ddvr-2">the TriBeCa Film Festival Interactive Showcase</a>, <a href="https://www.icp.org/news/exploring-the-future-of-storytelling-ICP-hosts-first-ever-hackthephoto-event">the International Center of Photography</a>, <a href="https://shape.att.com/event/2018/schedule/artistic-collaboration-with-ai">AT&T Shape</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPXPQK83Z_Y">TEDxBoston</a>, <a href="https://mlconf.com/sessions/narrated-reality-can-machine-intelligence-enable/">MLconf</a>, <a href="https://www.doclab.org/2015/word-camera/">IDFA DocLab</a>, <a href="https://www.vividsydney.com/elevating-creativity-through-artificial-intelligence-ross-goodwin">Vivid Sydney</a>, <a href="https://phi-centre.com/en/event/embodied-narrative-sensory-stories-of-the-digital-age-2016/">Phi Centre</a>, <a href="https://grayarea.org/community-entry/ross-goodwin/">Gray Area</a>, the MIT Media Lab, <a href="https://newlearningtimes.com/cms/article/5030/learning-theater-spotlight-expanding-the">Columbia University Teacher’s College</a>, <a href="https://digitaltag.zhdk.ch/en/conference/speakers/ross-goodwin-oscar-sharp/">Zurich University of the Arts</a>, <a href="https://www.evilmadscientist.com/2015/lo-res-digital-art-mfny/">Maker Faire</a>, <a href="https://futureofstorytelling.org/project/word-camera">Future of Storytelling</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0bVyxi38Bc">GitHub Universe</a>, <a href="https://www.thestrangeloop.com/2017/narrated-reality.html">Strange Loop</a>, <a href="https://gotochgo.com/2019/speakers/728">GOTO Chicago</a>, Series Mania, <a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~psztg/cml/2016/speakers.html">the NeurIPS machine learning conference</a>, <a href="https://state-studio.com/participant/2016/ross-goodwin">STATE Festival</a>, <a href="https://fadmagazine.com/2016/10/11/creative-machines-humans-cyborgs-retune-2016/">Retune Festival</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MolassesBooks/posts/989181197784582">Molasses Books</a>, and other venues.</p>
